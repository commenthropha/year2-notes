The relation state r(R) of a relation R is the **set** of tuples currently in the relation.

- It is a subset of the Cartesian product of the domains of its attributes
	- This is because each domain contains the set of all possible values the corresponding attribute can take

Note that we can trivially state that the current relation state is a subset of the relation state containing all possible tuples
