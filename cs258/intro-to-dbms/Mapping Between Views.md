There are two types of mapping in the 3 Schema DBMS Architecture.
### Conceptual/Internal Mapping
- Lies between the conceptual level and the internal level. 
- Its role is to define the correspondence between the records and fields of the conceptual level and files and data structures of the internal level.
### External/Conceptual Mapping
- Lies between the external level and the Conceptual level. 
- Its role is to define the correspondence between a particular external and the conceptual view.
