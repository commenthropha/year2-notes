- A physical data model is a database design concept that defines how data will be stored in a storage medium, such as a block in a storage device. 
- It specifies the low-level implementation details, including data structures, storage formats, indexing mechanisms, and access paths. 
### Advantages
- This model ensures that data is organized efficiently to optimize performance and storage utilization. 
- It considers factors like storage constraints, hardware capabilities, and performance requirements to determine how data will be physically arranged in storage blocks, enabling efficient retrieval and manipulation of data during database operations.
