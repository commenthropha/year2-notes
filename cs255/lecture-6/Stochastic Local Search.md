Stochastic local search is a mix of:
- [[Local Search for CSPs (Greedy Descent)|Greedy Descent]]: Move to a lowest neighbour
- [[Random Walk]]: Taking some [[Random Steps (Randomised Greedy Descent)|random steps]]
- [[Random Restart (Randomised Greedy Descent)|Random Restart]]: Reassigning values to all variables

As a follow-up to this idea, we can begin to think about how to [[Comparing Stochastic Algorithms|compare stochastic algorithms]] as well as introduce examples of stochastic search techniques such as [[Simulated Annealing|simulated annealing]]
