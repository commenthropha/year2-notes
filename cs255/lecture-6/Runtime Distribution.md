A method of [[Comparing Stochastic Algorithms|comparing stochastic algorithms]]
### Methodology
- We plot the proportion of runs solved within a given runtime against an increasing runtime scale
- We can determine which algorithm is best based on how much time is available or how important it is to find a solution
