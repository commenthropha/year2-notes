# Knowledge Bases
We begin by establishing a series of definitions:
- [[Knowledge-Based Agents]]
- [[Knowledge Base]]
- [[Inference Engine]]
## Propositional Reasoning
Representing problems in terms of propositions is advantageous as it allows us to give rich, modular and concise descriptions of the world

Important ideas relating [[Atomic Proposition|atomic propositions]] and [[Knowledge Base|knowledge bases]] are that of:
- [[Entailment]]
- [[Inference]]
### CSPs in Propositional Form
We can describe constraints *extensionally* as tables of valid assignments to variables, or *intensionally* using propositions:

#### Advantages
- More concise
- More expressive
	- This is useful when are problems are more complex than single assignments of values to variables
