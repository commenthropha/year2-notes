We can characterise a CSP as a graph search problem in the following way:
- A node is an assignment of values to some of the variables
-` Neighbours of that node are one more or one less variable consistent with the constraints`
- The start node is the empty assignment
- A goal node is a total assignment that satisfies the constraints
