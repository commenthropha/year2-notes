Sometimes, generically, referred to as a "constraint graph"

- For each variable, we introduce a circular node
- For each constraint whose [[Scope of a Constraint|scope]] is the set of variables, we add a square node C for the constraint and an edge (or “arc”) (vi, C) for each i ∈ [k]

Note: sometimes we may omit the boxes and just label each arc
