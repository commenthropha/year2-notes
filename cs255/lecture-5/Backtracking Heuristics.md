### Minimum Remaining Values (MRV)
Choose the variable with the fewest legal values
### Degree Heuristic 
Choose the variable with the most constraints on remaining values 
- This attempts to reduce the branching factor of future choices
### Least Constraining Value (LCV)
Given a variable, choose the least constraining value
- i.e. the one which rules out the fewest values in other unassigned variables
