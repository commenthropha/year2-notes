# Constraint-Satisfaction Problems
## Notes
### Definition
A CSP is characterised by: 
- A set of *variables* {V1, V2, ..., Vn}
	- Each variable Vi has an associate *domain* D_Vi of possible values
	- Variables in a CSP are one of [[Types of CSP Variables|two types]]
- The existence of *hard constraints* for various subsets of the variables which specify legal combinations of values
- A solution to the CSP being an assignment of a value to each variable that satisfies all the constraints
#### For Optimisation Problems
- For optimisation problems, we instead have *soft constraints* and an associated *cost function* which describes the distance to constraint satisfaction
- An optimal solution is thus one which *minimises* the cost function
- Problems which contain a mix of hard and soft constraints are called *constrained optimisation problems*
	- As well as distinguishing between hard and soft constraints, we can further [[Types of CSP Constraints|categorise each constraint]]
### Examples of CSPs
- N-Queens Problem
- Crossword Puzzle
- Assignment Problems
- Timetable and Scheduling Problems
### Backtracking
A noteworthy brute-force approach to solving CSPs is the [[Generate-And-Test Algorithm|generate-and-test algorithm]]
- As the assignment space D has d^n elements, we would need to test d^n assignments and clearly trial-and-error would not be efficient
	- Instead, we can employ [[Backtracking Search|backtracking search]]
	- To further improve the efficiency of backtracking, we can implement a few [[Backtracking Heuristics|heuristics]]
### CSP as Graph Searching
One way to characterise a CSP is as a [[CSP as Graph Searching|graph search problem]]
### Constraint Networks
A [[Constraint Network|constraint network]] is a model that serves as a way of representing a CSP in a graph structure distinct from the above
#### Advantages
This model allows us to enforce [[Consistency|consistency]]; the two types of consistency conditions are:
- [[Domain Consistency]]
- [[Arc Consistency]]
### CSPs as Tree Searching
If the constraint graph is a tree (or forest), the CSP can be solved in *O*(n â€¢ d^2) - much better than the general O(d^n) bound

#### Nearly Tree-Structured CSPs
- A natural question is whether we can apply the efficiency improvements detailed above to CSPs which almost have a tree structure
- Formally, this means the number of nodes we need to eliminate from the CSP network such that a forest remains is small
	- A set of such variables is called a *cutset*
