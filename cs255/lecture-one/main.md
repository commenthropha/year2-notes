# Rational Agents
## Defining Agents
We can define an [[agent]] and understand that they work under practical constraints which often make perfect reasoning unattainable or impractical

Hence, a good agent is one which aligns closely with some *[[goals or preferences]]* and we can use a [[performance measure]] to judge this quantitatively

An action that maximises the expected value of the [[performance measure]] given the [[past experiences]] of the agent to date is what we would then define as a [[rational action]] *(i.e. doing the right thing)*

It is worth noting the **importance** of considering the [[past experiences]] of the [[agent]] to date
- Doesn't take long to think of a situation that would explain why this is the case
### Conditions for an agent to act intelligently
In general, we can outline the following 3 conditions for us to be able to say that an agent acts intelligently:
1. It is versatile in a changing environment and learns from experience
2. It works within practical constraints
3. It makes choices aligning with its goals and preferences
### Inputs to an Agent
1. [[Abilities]]
2. [[Goals or Preferences|Goals/Preferences]]
3. [[External Stimuli]] 
4. [[Past Experiences]]
5. Prior Knowledge

#### Example: Autonomous Car
##### Abilities
- Steer
- Accelerate
- Brake
etc.
##### Goals
- Get to destination
- Safety
- Timeliness
etc.
##### External Stimuli
- Peripheral Vision
- Cameras
- GPS
etc.
##### Past Experiences
- Commonly traversed routes
- Braking distance relative to speed
etc.
##### Prior Knowledge
- What signs mean
- What to stop for
etc.




## Dimensions of Complexity
This modules focuses on the engineering goal of designing useful, intelligent agents.

We can approach this design problem as being defined by 10 dimensions of complexity:
### 10 Dimensions
1. [[Modularity]]
2. [[Planning Horizon]]
3. [[Representation]]
4. Computational Limits
5. Learning
6. Sensing Uncertainty
7. Effect Uncertainty
8. Preference
9. Number of Agents
10. Interaction
