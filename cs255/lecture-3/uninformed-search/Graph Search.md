### Difference between Graph Search & Tree Search
Unlike [[Tree Search|tree search]], graph search techniques maintain a set of paths whose endpoints collectively form the "frontier" of exploration
#### Complexity Differences
Because of the fact that a set of paths is maintained instead of a search tree, graph search techniques often have higher space complexity
