# Problem Solving & Uninformed Search
## Problem Solving
A typical problem consists of a solution specification and a set of deterministic actions that an [[agent]] can take

A problem-solving agent takes the following steps:
1. [[Problem Formulation]]
2. [[Goal Formulation]]
3. [[Search]]
4. [[Execution]]

During the aforementioned steps, the agent may be:
- Offline
	- In this case, it doesn't acquire any new knowledge of the environment during the process
- Online
	- This is when the agent acts while gaining evolving knowledge about the environment

### Problem Solving as State-Spaces
We can represent problems as [[state-spaces]] to help us understand the problem better

In reality, the world is often too complex to represent all possible states and actions
	In these cases we make abstractions which allow for practical representations
