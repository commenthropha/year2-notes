### How To Obtain
Obtain bound on running time of algorithm on a random input as a function of input size N
### Advantages & Disadvantages
- “Random” needs careful definition: what is a random input? 
- Hard to accurately model real instances by random distributions 
- Algorithm tuned for one distribution may perform poorly on others
