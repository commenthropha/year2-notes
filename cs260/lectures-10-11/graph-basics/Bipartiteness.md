An [[Undirected Graphs|undirected graph]] G = (V,E) is bipartite if its vertices can be divided into two independent sets, U and V such that every edge (u, v) either connects a vertex from U to V or a vertex from V to U

In other words, it is bipartite if its nodes can be coloured red or blue such that every edge has one red end and one blue end
