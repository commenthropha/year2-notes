Given a connected graph G = (V, E) with real-valued edge weights Ce, a minimum spanning tree is a subset of the edges TâŠ† E such that T is a [[Spanning Trees|spanning tree]] whose sum of edge weights is minimised

### Cayley's Formula
There are n^(n-2) spanning trees of K^n (the complete graph with n vertices)
- This means that brute force is not a feasible option
### Lemma 1
#### Claim
A [[cycles|cycle]] and a [[cutset]] intersect in an even number of edges
