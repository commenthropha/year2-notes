A self-enforcing system, for our purposes, is one where none of the parties involved would want to further their own self interest to the detriment of the whole population
- In the case of 'matching medics', it means that no doctor and hospital have a reason to mutually deviate from the assignment that was computed
	- Some hospital `h` might prefer a different doctor `d` than the one they were assigned, but `d` wouldn't prefer `h` to that hospital that they were assigned to because `d` understands that the computed assignment is in their collective best interest

In other words, *a self-enforcing system is characterised by the absence of an incentive for any party to deviate from the computed assignment*
