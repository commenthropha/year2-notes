- The propagation delay represents the time spent physically transmitting bits over wires
- For a length of physical link *d* and a propagation speed in medium *s*, we have *dprop* = *d/s*
- This is distinct from the [[Transmission Delay|transmission delay]], which is a result of the [[Store-and-Forward Principle|store-and-forward principle]]
