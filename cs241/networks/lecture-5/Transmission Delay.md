- The transmission delay represents the delay caused by the [[store-and-forward principle]]
- We can also think of this is as the amount of time it takes to “push” all the bits of the [[Packets|packet]] onto a link
- For a [[Packets|packet]] of L bits over a link with a bandwidth of Rbps, we have *dtrans* = *L/R*
