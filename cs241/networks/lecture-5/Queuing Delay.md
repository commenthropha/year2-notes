- If the arrival rate to a link exceeds the transmission rate from the link, packets will queue at the sending router
	- Packets may also be dropped (lost) if the queuing buffer is full
- The queuing delay represents the time spent queuing, and is naturally dependent on the congestion level of the flow/routers
