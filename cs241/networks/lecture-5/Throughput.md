### Definition
Throughput describes the rate at which bits are transferred from source to destination in a given time window, and is unique to a given '[[Flow|flow]]'
### Bottleneck Link
The throughput between a communicating pair is bottle necked by the individual link on the path with the lowest throughput
### Total Throughput
- In a packet switched network, the total throughput may vary over time, as delays change and packets take different routes between [[End Host|end hosts]]
- If, in total, S bits are transmitted over T units of time, we can describe average throughput as the quotient S/T, while instantaneous throughput is itâ€™s derivative dS/dT
