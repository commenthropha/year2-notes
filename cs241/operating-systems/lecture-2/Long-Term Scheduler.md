- Much less frequent. It may take...
	- minutes between creating one process and the next.  

- The long-term scheduler controls the number of processes in memory. If this is stable...
	- the arrival rate of jobs is equal to the completion rate. 
	
- Processes can be described as either:
	- [[IO Bound]]
	- [[CPU Bound]]
		- Long-term scheduler strives for good process mix. 

- Time-sharing systems like Linux and Windows donâ€™t have a long-term scheduler, instead...
	- they dump all processes on the short-term scheduler.
