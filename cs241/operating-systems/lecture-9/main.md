# Threads (Part 2)
## Types of Threads
There are two main types of threads:
- [[User-level Threads]]
- [[Kernel-Level Threads]] 
## Threading Models
There are three main models of threading:
- [[One-To-One Model]]
- [[Many-To-One Model]]
- [[Many-To-Many Model]]
## Threading Strategies
### Definition
A threading strategy determines the interaction among threads within a process
### Strategies
- [[One-Thread-Per-Request Strategy]]
- [[Thread Pool Strategy]]
## Signal Handling
### Uses of Signals
In UNIX operating systems, signals are used to notify a process about the occurrence of certain events
### Types of Signals
- [[Synchronous Signals]]
- [[Asynchronous Signals]]
### Signal Lifecycle
All signals follow the same pattern irrespective of type:
- A signal is generated by a particular event
- A signal is delivered to the process to which it applies
- Once delivered the signal must be handled
### Types of Signal Handlers
- [[default]]
- [[user-defined]]
### Signals in Multi-Threaded Applications
- In a multi-threaded program, signals can be sent to a specific thread, or to all threads
- Synchronous signals are usually sent to the thread which gave rise to them, while some asynchronous signals (like `SIGINT`) are to sent to all threads
