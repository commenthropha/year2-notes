Economy
	Thread creation and switching has lower overhead than the equivalent operations on processes
Scalability
	Due to low overhead, we can maintain a large number of concurrent threads
Responsiveness
	One thread is able to continue execution even while others are blocked
Resource Sharing
	Threads of the same process share resources; this is simpler than shared memory/message passing
