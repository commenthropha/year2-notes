For efficiency and protection, users cannot control IO devices directly. As a result, the operating system is required to control IO devices through device drivers and interrupts
### Advantages of having the OS controlling IO instead of the program directly
- More **efficient** because users do not need to write codes to perform IO
- More **secure** because multiple programs cannot access the same I/O device simultaneously
