There are two primary types of errors
## Hardware Errors
### Examples
- CPU Failure
- Memory Failure
- I/O Device Failure

## User (Program) Errors
### Examples
- Arithmetic overflow
- Illegal memory access



In all cases, the OS handles the error either by:
- Invoking an error handling routine
- Shutting down the process causing the error
